  description: Bats are hardly seen in the day as they are nocturnal. They have diverse
    diets and they can be nectivorous (nectar-eating), frugivorous (fruit-eating)
    or insectivorous (insect-eating). Hence, they play an important role in the ecosystem
    by pollinating flowers, dispersing seeds, and controlling insect populations.
