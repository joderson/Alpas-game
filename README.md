# Alpas-game
Alpas is a 2D top-down RPG game inspired by "Pokémon". What makes Alpas unique is it's Singapore themed maps, NPCs, animals and incorporation of learning elements. The purpose of the game is to encourage students to learn well having fun as well as understand Singapore's landscape and dynamics through the game.

# Motivation
As gamers ourselves, we decided that since games are already so addictive why not benefit ourselves from them? When we were young, we did not have much interest in reading a variety of books to expand our knowledge, but instead, would prefer spending our time playing video games. At that point in time, the video games that we played were not developed for educational purposes. We played it just because it was fun. As a result, we were often lacking behind our peers academically in school because we spent too much time on games that did not benefit us in the long run. 

Hence we decided to incorporate certain learning elements into games that would be beneficial to its users as video games are growing increasingly popular among children and young adults. We concluded that the game should not only help the player grow their academic level but also their critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they are essential life skills. However, the game should still be enjoyable for the user to continue playing.
Vision:
We hope to make learning fun and interactive for children and young adults in Singapore by encouraging learning through challenges and rewards in our video game. In addition, we also hope they will be able to develop essential life skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.

# Storyline
Your parents Dr. Mary(Mom), and Dr. Richard(Dad) just found out that their junior/subordinate, Dr. Doom, has become an evil scientist. Doctor Doom, has created a virus that he has injected into innocent rats in Singapore. He did not realise that one of the rats had escaped his lab and spread the virus all around Singapore. This virus will make animals go bizarre and attack humans if they are not trained. Your goal is to save these animals by battling them and training them to be immune to the virus. To win this game, you have to prevent the virus from spreading by destroying Doctor Doom's lab.

As Doctor Doom is an evil Mathematics genius, he made the virus in a way where the antidote for upgrading each animal could be obtained by a series of Mathematics questions. Hence, in order to train these animals to be immune to the virus, your goal is to solve these Mathematics and IQ questions.

After obtaining and training these strong animals, you are then ready to battle Doctor Doom’s assistants. Doctor Doom has 4 lab assistants, Echo, Eve, Pyro and Viper, where each assistant conquers one part of the map. Echo will be conquering the Central map, Eve will be conquering the North map, Pyro will be conquering the South map and Viper will be conquering the West map. Lastly, Doctor Doom will be conquering the East map. 

Firstly, you will have to defeat Echo the lab assistant in the Central map to unlock the next battle arena which is in the North map where Eve is conquering. After successfully battling Eve in the North map, the next battle arena in the South map will be unlocked. Then after successfully battling Pyro in the South map, the next battle arena in the West map will be unlocked. Then after successfully battling Viper in the West map, the next battle arena in the East map will be unlocked. After successfully battling all 4 lab assistants, you are ready to battle Doctor Doom, the true evil scientist who has created this all and he will be in the East map. Doctor Doom will be the last level of the game. You must successfully battle against Doctor Doom’s animals to win the game :)
